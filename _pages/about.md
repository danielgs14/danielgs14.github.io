Hey! Thanks for visiting. I'm Daniel Gonzalez Suarez, a Costa Rican marine biologist. So far, I have graduated from a bachelor's degree in Marine Biology and a master's degree in Coastal Oceanography. I'm mostly interested in studying marine invertebrate larvae and their development.

I have mostly worked with early developmental stages of sea urchins, exposing them to environmental stressors to understand their responses to climate change. I've been fascinated by how life develops under our dynamic oceans and want to spend my career answering questions on how marine invertebrate larvae exist.

For the past two and a half years, I have been working as an Analytics Engineer at Hakkoda, a data consultancy company. Data for Good, our social responsibility program, has a marine conservation chapter and I am currently developing a proposal to work with coral gardening so our team can offer automation solutions for their analyses and remarkably reduce working time. 

As a scientist and engineer, I believe in converting complex outputs into simple yet powerful insights. I seek to develop accelerators and automate tasks to streamline productivity.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
