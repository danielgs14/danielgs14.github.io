## International Dives
I've been fortunate enough to dive in three different times outside Costa Rica. First time was in Yucatán, México, for a course on Taxonomy, Systematics, and Ecology of Echinoderms in 2019. Then I got to dive in Baja California, México to capture sea urchins for my master's experiments. Last year (2024), I went to Tenerife to present my master's thesis on the 17<sup>th</sup> International Echinoderm Conference but stayed longer to do some experiments and vacationing. I had already visited Tenerife in 2018 for my undergrad's final project and performed an experiment on *Sphaerechinus granularis* larvae. The only paper I have so far is about its early developmental stages. You can find it here: [Early developmental stages of the sea urchin *Sphaerechinus granularis* (Lamarck, 1816) (Echinoidea: Toxopneustidae)]([https://www.researchgate.net/publication/361435295_Early_developmental_stages_of_the_sea_urchin_Sphaerechinus_granularis_Lamarck_1816_Echinoidea_Toxopneustidae])


## Boca Cangrejo
First dive was at Boca Cangrejo, in the Northeastern side of the island. It was quite the experience as I didn't know we were using steel tanks instead of aluminium ones. I was overburdened because I wasn't sure how much weight I needed by using a thicker wetsuit - in Costa Rica, either I don't use one or a 3mm one. Either way, it was a frustrating but adventorous dive, down to 40 m! The first picture I took was of the bearded fireworm *Hermodice carunculata* and its one of my favorite ones.

Due to the overweight, I wasn't able to fully enjoy the dive, but I still took some pictures.

## Radazul
Diving operations in Tenerife are quite different - more developed - than the ones in Costa Rica, but what they did have in common is nice, welcoming people. I enjoyed my dive with [Macaronesian Divers](https://macaronesiandivers.com/en/) with Daniel as our divemaster. We were expected to go alone but there was a walk-in couple at the last minute; I don't think it's common here in Costa Rica to have walk-ins for diving! We had lots of fun.

## AI stuff?
Taking pictures of moving fish hasn't been easy for me. I saw an eye-catching *Pomacanthus zonipectus* in its juvenile stage.

        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/tenerife-julaug24/pomacanthus_zonipectus.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}

    </div>
</div>
The picture to the left is a crop from the original. The one to the right was cropped even more because I wanted to align the fish to the center, as well as to rotate it. By doing the croppings, of course the picture gets smaller but using PhotoShop, I asked the tool to expand the background using generative AI. I think it's a good choice to save some pictures, though I'm definitely not a fan of GenAI art and its use so far. 

## So close yet so far

In this picture, you see mainly two species: *Rhopalea birkelandii* and *Tubastraea coccinea*. The first one is an ascidian and the second one a cnidarian, like the first mystery creature. Even though they look quite alike and both are benthic organisms (meaning they are bounded to the sea floor), they are quite different in a phylogenetic sense. What.

    </div>

Explaning phylogenetics may come in a separate post as this one comes packed with lots of information. For now, just look at that contrast!
