## Bullies and gliders

In Islas Murciélago, (North Pacific coast of) Costa Rica, there is a diving point where you can have a meet and greet with **[bull sharks](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/39372/2910670)**. It works as a cleaning station during a season so it has become an attractive point to get to know these amazing creatures up close. I went again with **[@diving_center_cuajiniquil](https://www.instagram.com/diving_center_cuajiniquil/)**!
My first encounter with a these creatures was a close one, as seen in the video below. Close enough to admire its size and beauty but not to get scared, I believe. A majestic animal, indeed! We saw around nine sharks and also got lucky enough to have two manta rays **[*Mobula birostris*](https://marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=1026118)** gracefully glide above us.

This was my second time using the camera underwater. Even though I'm not an expert, each time it feels much more comfortable, like second nature. Current setup weighs around 2.5 kg, which compared to other cameras, isn't as heavy, but I still have to compensate your buoyancy.

## The smaller size of the spectrum

Ocean creatures have a wide range of sizes. Think of whale sharks and then of hermit crabs. I prefer to photograph the ones in the smaller side of the spectrum - especially marine invertebrates. Macro photography helps with this. Look at this tiny sea urchin:

    </div>
</div>

**[*Eucidaris thouarsii*](https://marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=513266)**, the slate pencil sea urchin.

I find marine invertebrates to be so interesting. What I like the most of them is their life history. Did you know there are many that have a larval stage? Like a caterpillar getting into a cocoon to then *metamorphose* into a butterfly, many marine invertebrates start as larvae that then metamorphose into juveniles and finally develop into adults. Same as with butterflies, most larval stages look nothing like their adult counterparts. You wouldn't guess what a sea urchin larva looks like! I'll have a post about this specific life stages and some examples.

## Curious creatures and interesting sightings
We can hop back into the photography part of this trip. In this dive, as soon as I got into the water, I saw this magnificent octopus! Later, I got to see another one hidden in a crevice.

    </div>
</div>

Here's a picture of that same octopus, as well as another one I took later of another individual:

        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/cuajiniquil-may24/octopus-1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

Other interesting sights I got to see:
<div class="row mt-3">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/cuajiniquil-may24/astropyga.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/cuajiniquil-may24/telmatactis.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}
    </div>
</div>

The first one is a fire sea urchin, **[*Astropyga pulvinata*](https://marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=513138)**, and this was my first time seeing it in the wild. Next to it, you can see a club-tipped anemone, **[*Telmatactis*](https://marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=100766)** sp., possibly *T. panamensis*. Years ago, I found another individual of this genus, but it looked like **[*Telmatactis cricoides*](https://marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=100971)**, an Atlantic Ocean species. To make sure which species these are, samples should be taken for at least morpholohical analysis. As I was going for a recreational dive and there were no intentions to collect, it made no sense to do anything other than taking pictures of it.

    </div>
</div>
  
This is the same slate pencil sea urchin as seen before, but with its spines covered with something green. This is possibly a sponge from the **[*Clathria*](https://marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=131868)** genus. I'm no expert on sea sponge identification but I sustained my observation **[based on this record](https://mapress.com/zt/article/view/zootaxa.3085.1.3)**. If you pay close attention to the spines, you can see **[brittle star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brittle_star)** arms surrounding the spines.

    </div>
</div>

This fish belongs to the **[Labridae](https://biogeodb.stri.si.edu/sftep/en/thefishes/taxon/1639)** family. These are common fishes but the one you're seeing here might be **[*Halichoeres discolor*](https://marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=275762#distributions)**, an endemic species to the Costa Rican oceanic island Isla del Coco. It wouldn't be crazy to find species from Isla del Coco in Costa Rican coastal waters, but I didn't find many occurrences for it. 

## More of our fauna

Next, you can see fishes from the [Serranidae](https://www.fishbase.se/summary/FamilySummary.php?ID=289) family. These are sea basses and groupers. First and third picture are possibly *[Cephalopholis panamensis](https://biogeodb.stri.si.edu/sftep/es/thefishes/species/1115)*, while the second one might be *[Epinephelus labriformis](https://biogeodb.stri.si.edu/sftep/es/thefishes/species/1125)*, one of the first fish I saw on my first time snorkeling!
